# Semester-3
<i>Here is all codes I did during my 3rd semester.<i><br><br>
<b>BSc. in Software Engineering</b><br>
<b>IIT, University Of Dhaka<b>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<p>
  <b>CSE-301: Combinatorial Optimization </b><br>
  Here is all codes in C++ language. These codes include Greedy Algorithm, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithm, Network Flow, String Matching etc".
</p>  

<br>
<p>
  <b>CSE-311: Computer Networking </b><br>
  This course includes Physical Layer, Network Layer, Link Layer, Transport Layer and Application Layer. In this course we learn how to capture packet with Wireshark and analyzing packets and protocol. Finally  how a Web Request works!
</p>  

<br>

<p>
  <b>MATH-304: Numerical Analysis </b><br>
  Here is all codes in C++ language. This code includes solution in one variable(Bisection, Newton Rhapson, False Position, Secant Method), Differentiation, Integration, Linear Algebra, Matrix Algebra, Eigenvalue, Eigen Vector etc. 
</p>

<br> 

<p>
  <b>SE-312: Theory of Computing </b><br>
  Here is all codes in C++ language. These codes include DFA (Deterministic Finite Automata), NFA (Non-deterministic Finite Automata), Regular Expression, CFG (Context Free Grammar), PDA (Push-down Automata) etc more.
</p>  

<br> 

<p>
  <b>SE-305: Software Project Lab-1 </b><br>
  I have another repository named "SPL-1" where I have done this Project Lab. 
</p>  

<br>

<p>
  <b>SE-306: Object Oriented Concepts-II </b><br>
  Here is all codes in Java language. These codes are the advanced Object Oriented Concepts in Java including Java Collection Framework, Java File IO, Java Exception Handling, Java Generics, Java Thread and also Java Reflection.
</p>
